## json_env

[json_env](https://github.com/brodo/json_env) is [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv), but with JSON.
It loads environment variables from JSON files (`.env.json` per default) and starts a subprocess with them. 
Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on [The Twelve-Factor](http://12factor.net/config) App methodology.
It is also my first Rust project.
